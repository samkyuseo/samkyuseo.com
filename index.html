                I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of
				Southern California (USC). I am pursuing a minor in Jazz Studies and am also a member of 
				USC's Thornton Jazz Band. I recently joined Scope SC, a community of computer science students 
				who come together to learn new skills during meetings and apply them in hackathons. I am also 
				the scholarship chair in Phi Delta Theta, a social fraternity. I spearheaded our mentorship program,
				which connects alumni in the workforce (mentors) to current active brothers (mentees).

              <p>
                I currently work as a full stack web developer for the USC
                Norman Lear Center (NLC). I was hired to develop a searchable
                web-database of US television transcripts. It allows faculty of
                the NLC get all TV transcripts containing a key word entered
                along with a related set of meta data.

              <h2>How I got here</h2>
              <p>
                While I am a US citizen, I was born and raised in Korea where I
                attended Seoul International School. I moved to Bangkok,
                Thailand during middle school and graduated from the
                International School of Bangkok with academic honors.

          <p>
            My current passion is in full stack application development since it
            allows me to quickly turn my ideas in to reality. In particular, my
            favorite webstack is MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node.js (MERN).

              <h3>Full Stack Application Development</h3>
              <p>
                I've created websites with modern webstacks like MERN and more
                traditional ones like Java and JDBC. I am also able to make iOS
                applications using Swift.

              <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
              <p>
                Through rigorous courses, I've built a strong foundation in this
                topic. My course work required me to create advanced data
                structures from scratch, including AVL trees, minheaps, and
                hashtables using C++.

              <h3>Computer Systems</h3>
              <p>
                I am able to parse and understand x86-64 assembly code. I've
                built C programs to detect signed and unsigned overflow,
                calculate floating point division and more. I recently completed
                the infamous bomb lab!

              <h3>Networked Programs</h3>
              <p>
                I've programed using multi-threading, remote client-server
                interfacing, locks, and conditions in Java. My most notable
                project in this area is a crossword puzzle game that allows
                multiple clients to connect to a game server and play on the
                same puzzle.

				<h4>USC NetCat</h4>
					<p>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/netcat.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						I dreaded having to look through 5-7 different websites just to find all the juicy techtalks, career fairs, and networking events occuring 
						at USC. After talking to a few friends, I realized that many people had the same concerns. Enter USC NetCat (short for USC Network Cataloge), 
						a website that centralizes all career/ networking event data at USC into one convenient location. We automatically extract all the career data 
						using Selenium and Beautiful soup, divide them by major and type, and display it on the website.

					<h4>Norman Lear Center TV Database</h4>
					<p>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/nlctvdb.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						This is the website I was hired to create by the Norman Lear Center (NLC). Its a searchable web database of US television 
						transcripts that returns all transcripts along side relevant meta data containing a key word typed in the search bar. 
						I learned a ton about modern webstacks, backend database management, and reading third-party API documentation 
						while building this. It was an amazing learning experience! Additionally, it helped the NLC save a lot of 
						money since they no longer need to pay dozens of part time workers to search transcripts and extract meta data manually. 
						Unfortunately, I can't post the link to the website because the NLC paid for the third-party api's services and they asked not 
						to make the website totally public.
