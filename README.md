# My Personal Website

A portfolio website but really just trying to learn react-typescript along with Mantine as a frontend CSS framework.

## Mantine

### Mantine Docs

Mantine documentation includes more than 150 pages so to use it efficiently remember 2 keyboard shortcuts:

`⌘ + K or Ctrl + K` – focus search field, searching components and hooks is the best way to jump straight to the page you are looking for.
`⌘ + J or Ctrl + J` – toggle color scheme (light/dark). All components support both color schemes and using this shortcut is the easiest way to preview both color schemes.

### Mantine packages

`@mantine/hooks` – collection of 30+ react hooks for state and UI management.
`@mantine/styles` – emotion based css-in-js library that is used in all Mantine components. Usually this package is installed automatically and exported from `@mantine/core` – there is no need to install it separately, learn more about createStyles here.
`@mantine/core` – core components library – 100+ components, exports everything from `@mantine/styles`.
`@mantine/notifications` – a fully featured notifications system.
`@mantine/prism` – code highlight built with prism-react-renderer.
`@mantine/rte` – a Quill based rich text editor.
`@mantine/dropzone` – manages files drag 'n' drop of files to an area or the entire screen.
`@mantine/ssr` – server side rendering utilities.
`@mantine/next` – components and ssr utils for Next.js integration.
`@mantine/eslint`-config – ESLint and Prettier configuration that the Mantine project uses.
